neural networks are cool

so basically you have neurons and they connect together. the math is like weights times inputs plus bias and then activation function.

you can use python for this. just install tensorflow or pytorch.

**here is some code

print("hello world")

thats basically it. neural networks are used in lots of things like image recognition and nlp and stuff. you should learn more about them because they are important for AI.

the end
