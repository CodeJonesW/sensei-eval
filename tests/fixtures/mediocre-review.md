Your sorting function works but there are a few things to improve.

The main issue is error handling — you should add more error handling throughout the code. For example, what happens if someone passes in null or undefined? You should validate your inputs.

Also, the variable naming could be better. Instead of using single-letter variables, try using more descriptive names so the code is easier to read.

You might also want to consider adding some comments to explain what the more complex parts of your code are doing.

Finally, think about edge cases. There are probably some edge cases you haven't considered that could cause bugs.

Overall it's decent but needs some polish. Keep working on it.
